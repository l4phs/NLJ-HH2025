This is our mad awesome Hackathon Idea :D
A wellness app that promotes healthy living and habits. To prevent sadness, reach all of your daily health goals each day to keep your panda(s) alive! The app is cute and user-friendly and documents every aspect of your health journey. 

No one wants to be an evil animal killer, so meet your fitness goals and keep that cute little panda ALIVE! (if this is not motivating enough...where is your humanity?)

**Look at SmallTalk usage.md for information (aka code and descriptions) related to small talk used in this app.**

Smalltalk was used in this application via Pharo and was used to process data regarding how many steps a user walked. Calling the following method in VSCode updates the CSV for our program. This data is then used for our average page to supply statistics and the backend of our program.

This is our mad awesome Hackathon Idea :D
A wellness app that promotes healthy living and habits. To prevent sadness, reach your daily health goals each day to keep your panda(s) alive! The app is cute and user-friendly and documents every aspect of your health journey. 

No one wants to be an evil animal killer, so meet your fitness goals and keep that cute little panda ALIVE! (if this is not motivating enough...where is your humanity?)
